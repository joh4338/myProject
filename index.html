<p1> Giant Pandas are native to Central China, and live in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains. They eat a lot of bamboo up to 12 hours everyday, occasionally they will eat small animals and fish. In captivity Giant Pandas only live to be about 30 years old. Giant Pandas are endangered because China is growing fast, and their habitat is being taken over and replaced by development. This causes them to have to live in smaller areas, and have less food avaliablility. Because if humans, there are only about 1,864 Giant Pandas left in the wild.

<p2> Due to global warming, Polar bears population is decreasing, since global warming is melting their habitat and causing them not to have anywhere to live. Polar bears are the largest of all bears, ranging from about 10 feet tall when they're standing on their hind legs to 3.5 to 5 feet when they aren't, also a male polar bear weighs anywhere from 775 to 1,200 pounds. Most polar bears live in countries that surround the Artic Circle, which includes Russia, Canada, Alaska, Greenland, and Norway. Currently there are only about 25,000 polar bears in the wild.

<p> In the 19th century, sea otters were hunted to almost extincetion. In 1989 the Exxon Valdez there was an oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound, which ended up killing several thousand sea otters. Sea Otters are killed for their fur, which people then make into capes, belts, and sashes which are all very popular. Today, most sea otters live in shallow costal waters off the Northern Pacific, they used to live near Japan, along the coast of Siberia to Aleutian Chain and down the Alsaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California coast to Baja California. Today, researchers have estimated there to be about 106,000 otters.
