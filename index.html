<h5> Giant Panda </h5>
<p1> Giant Pandas are native to Central China, and live in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains. They eat a lot of bamboo up to 12 hours everyday, occasionally they will eat small animals and fish. In captivity Giant Pandas only live to be about 30 years old. Giant Pandas are endangered because China is growing fast, and their habitat is being taken over and replaced by development. This causes them to have to live in smaller areas, and have less food avaliablility. Because if humans, there are only about 1,864 Giant Pandas left in the wild.
